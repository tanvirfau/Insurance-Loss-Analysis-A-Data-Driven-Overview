## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the financial performance of an insurance company based on data from 2014-2018. The company faced consistent losses, primarily due to policyholders claiming more money than the premiums collected, which led to its closure in 2019. This report, visualized using **Power BI**, explores the key trends and patterns that contributed to the company’s financial struggles.

## Key Insights
The analysis provides the following insights:
- **Premium vs. Claims**: The premiums collected were consistently lower than the claims paid out, which resulted in continuous financial losses.
- **Premium to Claims Ratio**: The ratio remained alarmingly low at **44%**, indicating the company was paying more in claims than it was earning through premiums.
- **Trends Over Time**: While there was a brief improvement in the Premium-to-Claims ratio in Q2 of 2018, the company’s losses were too large to recover.
- **Claims Data Analysis**: The analysis identified sectors where claims were disproportionately higher than premiums, such as **Agricultural** and **Private** categories.

## Data Preparation
The dataset used in this project includes:
- Insurance policies and claims data from 2014 to 2018.
- Information on premiums, claims, vehicle types, and claim amounts.
- Raw data was cleaned and transformed using **Power Query** in **Power BI**.

The key steps taken during data preparation include:
1. **Data Formatting**: Proper formatting of dates and numeric values.
2. **Missing Data Handling**: Ensuring no missing values disrupted the analysis.
3. **Aggregation**: Aggregating data by year and relevant categories for a more meaningful analysis.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard created for this project includes several visualizations that highlight key insights:
- **Premium to Claims Ratio** over time.
- **Cumulative Underwriting Losses** showing the growing financial deficit.
- **Claims by Sector** identifying which categories had higher claims relative to premiums.
- **Average Premium vs. Claim** scatter plot, showing the correlation between premiums and claims.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used to create the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
- **Power Query**: Used for cleaning and transforming the raw dataset.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Utilized for calculating metrics such as the **Premium-to-Claims ratio** and averages.
- **Data Visualization**: Employed different chart types, including bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots, to highlight the trends in the data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how an unsustainable Premium-to-Claims ratio can lead to financial instability in the insurance industry. By using Power BI, the project sheds light on the reasons behind the company's closure, providing insights that can inform future insurance strategies. Through data analysis and visualization, this project serves as a valuable case study on managing risk and ensuring financial health in the insurance sector.
